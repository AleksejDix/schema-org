# Migrate from v0 to v1

## High Risk - Breaking Changes

### Partial define functions removed

To allow for empty define functions while providing a strict API, the `define${Node}Partial` functions existed. This has been removed to simplify the API. 

You will need to remove any define partial functions in favour of the main define functions.

::code-group

```ts [Before - v0]
defineWebPagePartial({
  // ...
})
```

```ts [Current - v1]
defineWebPage({
  // ...
})
```

### Component prop `render-scoped-slots` removed

Previously you were able to provide the `render-scoped-slots` prop to allow scoped slots to render. This was useful
to minimise code, but was removed as the functionality was misleading.

You will now need to render within the default slot.

::code-group

```vue {3} [Before - v0]
<template>
  <SchemaOrgQuestion render-scoped-slots>
    <template #question>
    What is the question?
    </template>
    <template #answer>
    Not sure
    </template>
  </SchemaOrgQuestion>
</template>
```

```vue  [Current - v1]
<template>
  <SchemaOrgQuestion>
    <template #question>
    What is the question?
    </template>
    <template #answer>
    Not sure
    </template>
    <div>
      <div class="font-bold mb-3 text-xl">What is the question?</div>
      <div>Not sure</div>
    </div>
  </SchemaOrgQuestion>
</template>
```

## Medium Risk - Worth Checking

### SSR by default

### Logic Changes to Graph Resolution

### New Reactivity
